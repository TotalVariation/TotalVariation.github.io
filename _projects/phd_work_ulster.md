## PhD Work at AIRC UU

I had the opportunity to begin my PhD journey at the Artificial Intelligence Research Centre (<a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/research/topic/computer-science/artificial-intelligence">AIRC</a>), Ulster University (UU), Belfast, UK, with the support of a fully-funded Department for the Economy (DfE) international studentship. While my path led me to discontinue the program after two years, I've chosen to share some of the research I conducted at AIRC, UU, particularly in the areas of Deep Generative Models and Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. I hope these findings may serve as a reference for fellow researchers in the field.

## Other Research Proposals

Additionally, I would like to share two research proposals that played a significant role in securing two fully-funded PhD opportunities, with the hope that they may offer some reference value to you as well.

## Remarks

Rejection is a common part of the PhD application process. If you encounter setbacks, don't be discouraged. Make sure to prioritize self-care, make an informed decision and find the best match.
