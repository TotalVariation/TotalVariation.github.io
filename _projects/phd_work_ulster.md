## PhD Work at AIRC UU

I embarked on my PhD journey in September 2021 at the Artificial Intelligence Research Centre (<a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/research/topic/computer-science/artificial-intelligence">AIRC</a>), Ulster University (UU), Belfast, UK, as a recipient of a fully-funded international studentship from the Department for the Economy (DfE). Persistent harassment from the very beginning of my studies led me to leave the program prematurely, despite multiple formal reports to various levels of UU. After two harrowing years, I decided to discontinue my PhD on November 30, 2023. In this blog post, I want to share some of the research I conducted at AIRC, particularly in the areas of Deep Generative Models and Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. I hope these findings may serve as reference for fellow researchers in the field.

## Other Research Proposals

Additionally, I would like to share two research proposals that played a significant role in securing two fully-funded PhD opportunities, with the hope that they may offer some reference value to you as well.

## Remarks

Rejection is a common part of the PhD application process. If you encounter setbacks, don't be discouraged. Make sure to prioritize self-care, make an informed decision and find the best match.
