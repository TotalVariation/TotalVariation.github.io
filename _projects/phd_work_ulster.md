I had the opportunity to begin my PhD journey at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), Ulster University (UU), Belfast, UK, with the support of a fully-funded Department for the Economy (DfE) international studentship. While my path led me to discontinue the program after two years, I've chosen to share some of the research I conducted at AIRC, UU, particularly in the areas of Deep Generative Models and Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. I hope these findings may serve as a reference for fellow researchers in the field.
