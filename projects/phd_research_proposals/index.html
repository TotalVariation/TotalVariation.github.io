Over the past few years, I have applied to multiple PhD programs, continuously refining my proposal-writing skills along the way. In this blog post, I would like to share some of the research proposals that helped me make a strong impression during my applications. My hope is that by sharing these examples, future PhD applicants can find inspiration and practical guidance as you shape your own proposals, boosting the chances of securing your dream PhD opportunities.</p> <ol> <li><a href="/assets/pdf/research_proposal_person_reid_xcai.pdf"><b>Person Re-ID</b></a></li> <li><a href="/assets/pdf/Research_Proposal_EarthObservation_xcai.pdf"><b>Remote Sensing &amp; Earth Observation</b></a></li> <li><a href="/assets/pdf/research_proposal_time_series_analysis_xcai.pdf"><b>Fruit Ripeness Prediction</b></a></li> <li><a href="/assets/pdf/Blending_Fast_and_Slow_Thinking_Unlocking_the_Power_of_Multimodal_Large_Language_Models_xcai.pdf"><b>Multimodal Large Language Models</b></a></li> </ol> </body></html>
